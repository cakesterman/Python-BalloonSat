# Python-BalloonSat
Project for my Balloon Sat that was worked on at Army Cyber Institue at West Point

Database info was not added nor are any images attatched to the project.

This project had a database of BSSIDS, Lat, Long, and altitude  that were recorded with a balloon traveling over a part of the North East.  It checked those BSSIDS with a couple different public wifi databases and checked if there were any matches.  

It also added exif data to the photos that were captured from a pi on the balloon.  The added exif data was lat, long and altitude.

Lastly, it changed the rotation of all the photos to be vertical.
